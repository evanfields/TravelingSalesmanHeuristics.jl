`TravelingSalesmanHeuristics` is a Julia package containing simple heuristics for the [traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). 

I welcome any contributions, suggestions, feature requests, pull requests, criticisms, etc. The package has reached a stable usable state, and while ongoing development is sporadic, I attempt to keep the package well-maintained.
