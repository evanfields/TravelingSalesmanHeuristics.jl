.. solve_tsp(distmat) ..

One-line interface to approximately solving a TSP by specifying a distance matrix.
This method provides fairly quick solutions but no extra control. For more fine-grained
control over the heuristics used, try nearest_neighbor or cheapest_insertion.

# path generation heuristics

"""
Approximately solve a TSP using the nearest neighbor heuristic. You must pass a square matrix
distmat where distmat[i,j] represents the distance from city i to city j. The matrix needn't be
symmetric and possibly could contain negative values, though nonpositive values have not been tested.


Optional arguments:

firstCity: specifies the city to begin the path on. An empty Nullable corresponds to random selection. 
	This argument is ignored if repetitive = true. Defaults to an empty Nullable{Int}
	
repetitive: boolean for whether to try starting from all possible cities, keeping the best. Defaults to false.

closepath: boolean for whether to include the arc from the last city visited back to the first city in
	cost calculations. If true, the first city appears first and last in the path. Defaults to true.
	
do2opt: whether to refine the path found by 2-opt switches (corresponds to removing path crossings in
	the planar Euclidean case). Defaults to true.
	
returns a tuple (path, pathcost) where path is a Vector{Int} corresponding to the order of cities visited

.. cheapest_insertion(distmat, initpath) ..


Given a distance matrix and an initial path, complete the tour by
repeatedly doing the cheapest insertion. The initial path must have length at least 2, but can be
simply [i, i] for some city index i which corresponds to starting with a self-loop at city i.
Insertions are always in the interior of the current path so this heuristic can also be used for
non-closed TSP paths.
Currently the implementation is a naive n^3 algorithm.
